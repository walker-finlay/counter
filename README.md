Sprint Questions

1. What was the final state of your project after one week?
We have a lot of the individual pieces of the project finished but they don't necessarily work together.  For example we have a frontend working (save for the multiple counters) and a potentially working backend but they don't actually fit together.
2. How was the project divided? Who did what? 
Our project was divided into what each person was strongest in, which worked out as most people had a strength that was another's weakness.  With that in mind Walker focused on database and SQL queries to connect the database, olivia focused on the backend requests and routes. Wesley mainly focused on getting the frontend working.  Kingsley did ajax calls to backend and assisted with front end development 
3. What challenges did you face in working on this project that prevented progress?
Meeting was tough to get everybody in the same place at the same time so we ended up not meeting as a full group in person more than twice.  We also ran out of time towards the end.
4. What would you do differently for the rest of your capstone work?
I think starting earlier would have solved the previous problem discussed of not being able to meet all together, as well as we simply ran out of time at the end.  Going into future work in capstone we will definitely schedule meeting times earlier and more efficiently
